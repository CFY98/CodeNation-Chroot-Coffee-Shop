# Chroot

A concept e-commerce UI built around a terminal interface. Alongside the conventional point-and-click, users can interact with the shop using familiar git commands to browse, stage, and commit items to their basket.

Iterated on user feedback from external testers to introduce new features from v0.2.1 onwards.

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Basket UI** — Dynamic cart rendering with real-time quantity management and state synchronisation across components.
- **Accessibility** — ARIA live regions with custom announcements to ensure full screen reader compatibility.
- **Persistence** — localStorage for live basket state across pages, with local state object for pre-basket quantity adjustment.
- **SPA Routing** — React Router for seamless client-side navigation across UI modes.
- **Client-side PDF Generation** — On-demand receipt generation via deferred module import of html2pdf, with print-state cleanup via try/finally.

## 💻 Visual Mode Features

The UI features dual modes which users can select depending on their preferences. Visual mode offers the more traditional e-commerce UI experience. 

- **Toast Notifications** — Non-blocking user feedback for basket interactions.
- **State Memory** — In-memory state object for adjusting item quantities before adding to basket.

## ⌨️ Terminal Mode Features

Users can switch to Terminal mode if they prefer working in a terminal.

- **Git-inspired Commands** — Git-style commands (add, reset, status, commit, log) for basket interaction.
- **Keyboard Navigation** — History indexes accessible via arrow-keys for fast lookup.
- **Autocomplete** — Tab completion for commands and arguments based on the current input.
